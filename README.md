**Tasks Breakdown**\
***Task 1: Exploring Running Activities (2013-2018)***\
•	Focused on analyzing the dataset to isolate running activities from 2013 to 2018.\
•	Key insights included identifying variations in running distances, speeds, and heart rates, with visualizations capturing the evolution of these metrics over time.

***Task 2: Analyzing Running Statistics (2015-2018)***\
•	Analyzed running activities from 2015 to 2018, calculating annual and weekly averages for metrics like distance, speed, and heart rate.\
•	Calculated weekly counts to understand running frequency and assessed the progression of running habits.

***Task 3: Visualizing Running Data***\
•	Created visualizations to highlight trends in running performance, showing the relationship between distance and heart rate over time.\
•	Identified patterns of training intensity, rest periods, and notable deviations in performance.

***Task 4: Annual Running Goals (2013-2018)***\
•	Examined whether the runner met annual distance goals, setting a benchmark of 800 kilometers each year.\
•	Visualized annual performance and compared actual performance against the target distance.

***Task 5: Analyzing Running Progression (2013-2018)***\
•	Investigated long-term trends in running distances by breaking the data into weekly sums.\
•	Performed time series decomposition to identify overall trends, seasonality, and residuals.

***Task 6: Heart Rate Zone Analysis (2015-2018)***\
•	Focused on training intensity by categorizing running sessions into heart rate zones.\
•	Analyzed how often different zones were targeted and whether training intensity was balanced.

***Task 7: Consolidated Activity Summary (Running, Walking, Cycling)***\
•	Combined running, walking, and cycling data into a single dataset.\
•	Aggregated key metrics (distance, elevation, speed) for each activity type and visualized the overall fitness progress across these activities.

***Task 8: Fun Facts & Comparison to Forrest Gump's Epic Journey***\
•	Compared the real-life running statistics of the instructor to the fictional journey of Forrest Gump.\
•	Calculated fun facts such as the number of marathons equivalent to the total distance and shoe wear estimates.

**Key Insights**\
•	Training Intensity: The analysis of heart rate zones revealed the runner's training intensity across different zones (Easy, Moderate, Hard, Very Hard, Maximal), helping gauge how challenging their workouts were.\
•	Goal Achievement: The annual analysis showed whether the runner reached their set goals, providing valuable feedback for future goal setting.\
•	Progression: Time series decomposition helped illustrate the long-term progression in running distance, providing clarity on how consistently the runner improved.\
•	Activity Diversity: The summary of running, walking, and cycling activities gave a broader view of the runner's total fitness journey.

**Technologies Used**\
•	Python: The analysis and visualizations were done using Python, with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Statsmodels.\
•	Jupyter Notebooks: Interactive notebooks were used for data exploration, statistical analysis, and visualization.\
•	Git: Version control was used to manage code and track changes to the analysis.\
